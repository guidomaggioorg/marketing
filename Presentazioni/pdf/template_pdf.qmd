## I nostri formaggi

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished presentation. To learn more about Quarto presentations see <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/>.

## I nostri affettati

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes:

-   Content authored with markdown
-   Ha!

## Le nostre salse

When you click the **Render** button a presentation will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
1 + 1
# very long line with much code that could go into 2 rows if the screen is not large enough, if the font size is small, it would go beyond the right margin
```
